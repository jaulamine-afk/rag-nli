# RAG with NLI and Sub-Claim Decomposition

[Français](README.fr.md)

This project explores how Natural Language Inference (NLI) and claim decomposition can be integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to reduce retrieval noise and improve answer grounding.


## Motivation

Standard RAG systems often retrieve passages that are:

- loosely related to the question,
- partially contradictory,
- or irrelevant but semantically similar.

This noise can confuse the generator and degrade answer quality.

This project proposes:

- using NLI-based entailment filtering to keep only passages that logically support a claim,
- and an extension based on sub-claim decomposition for comparative or multi-entity questions.

## Approach Overview

Three pipelines are implemented and compared:

### RAG Baseline

- Dense retrieval (FAISS)
- Prompt-based generation

### RAG + NLI

- Retrieved passages are filtered using an NLI model
- Only passages that entail the claim are kept
- A detailed explanation of the method is available here [RAG + NLI](.docs/rag_nli.md).

### RAG + NLI + Sub-Claims

- Complex claims are decomposed into simpler sub-claims
- Each sub-claim is validated independently with NLI
- Passages are kept only if they support at least one sub-claim
- A detailed explanation of the method is available here [RAG + NLI + Sub-Claims](.docs/rag_nli_subclaim.md).

This allows finer-grained filtering, especially for comparative or compositional questions.

## Evaluation

Experiments were conducted on HotpotQA (distractor setting).

**Metrics used:**

- Exact Match
- F1
- BERTScore (Precision / Recall / F1)

Results show consistent improvements over the RAG baseline, with:

- reduced irrelevant passages,
- improved answer grounding,
- and clearer gains for composition-heavy questions.

## Analysis Agent (Demonstration)

In addition to quantitative evaluation, the project includes an analysis agent powered by Gemini.

This agent:

- compares answers from RAG vs RAG + NLI Sub-Claims,
- inspects retrieved passages before and after filtering,
- explains why one pipeline produces a more reliable answer.

This component is intended as a pedagogical and interpretability tool, not as part of the core evaluation loop.

## Running the Project

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run experiments

```bash
python -m scripts.run_experiments
```

This will run all pipelines on a subset of HotpotQA and output evaluation metrics.

### 3. Run the API

The project exposes a FastAPI service for question answering.

```bash
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

## API Key Configuration (Gemini)

Some components (analysis agent) use Gemini 2.5 Flash.

You need to generate an API key here:  
👉 https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Paste your API key in the `code_api.txt` file at the root of the project.

## Optional: Docker Deployment

The project can also be containerized using Docker for easier deployment and reproducibility.

A Dockerfile is provided to:

- install dependencies,
- expose the FastAPI service,
- run the application in a reproducible environment.

**Example commands:**

```bash
docker build -t rag-nli-app .
docker run -p 8001:8001 rag-nli-app
```

This setup was tested locally and deployed on an AWS EC2 (Ubuntu) instance.

## Limitations

- Sub-claim decomposition is rule-based and heuristic
- Not all claims in HotpotQA are decomposable
- No statistical significance testing (CPU-only setup)
- Focus is on retrieval noise reduction, not full hallucination prevention

These limitations are discussed transparently to emphasize realism and reproducibility.
